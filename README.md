# Introduction 

The purpose of this project is to show a sample of how TS changes variable names in the compiled JS.

# Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm i`.
3. Run `index.js` in a **debugger** like in VS Code.
4. Compare the value of `app` in the TS code with the compiled code.

You can also open [index.js](https://github.com/AskYous/ts-var-change-example/blob/master/index.js) right now without needing to clone this repository, and see how `app` in the TS was changed to `chatbot_info_1.app` in the JS. This can make debugging frustrating.
